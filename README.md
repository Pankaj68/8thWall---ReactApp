## Key Features

### iFrame Integration
The app uses a secure iFrame to load the 8th Wall AR experience with proper permissions for:
- Camera access
- Microphone access
- Accelerometer and gyroscope sensors
- XR spatial tracking

### Responsive Design

- Mobile: Optimized for portrait and landscape orientations
- Tablet: Adaptive layout for medium-sized screens

### Error Handling
- Loading states with spinner animation
- Error messages with retry functionality
- Graceful fallbacks for network issues

## Browser Compatibility

This app is optimized for modern browsers that support:
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- WebXR APIs (for AR functionality)
- iFrame sandboxing

## Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder with optimized production files.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Install gh-pages: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
2. Add to package.json scripts:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/autoviz-iframe-app",
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```
3. Deploy: `npm run deploy`

### Deploy to Netlify/Vercel
Simply connect your GitHub repository and deploy the build folder.

## Configuration

### Changing the 8th Wall URL
To load a different 8th Wall experience, update the `eighthWallUrl` constant in `src/App.js`:

```javascript
const eighthWallUrl = 'https://your-8th-wall-project.app/';
```

### Customizing Styling
Modify `src/App.css` to customize:
- Colors and gradients
- Layout and spacing
- Mobile responsiveness
- Loading animations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AR not loading**: Ensure the 8th Wall project URL is correct and accessible
2. **Camera permissions**: Make sure the site is served over HTTPS in production
3. **Mobile issues**: Test on actual devices as AR requires real sensors

### Browser Console
Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors or network issues.
